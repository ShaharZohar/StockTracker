## Stock Tracker App (Kotlin)

This is a simple Kotlin project for an Android app that allows users to track their favorite stocks. Users can:

* **Add Stocks:** Add stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, GOOG) to a personalized watchlist.
* **View Watchlist:** See a list of their added stocks.
* **Basic Stock Information (Future):** (Planned) Display basic stock information like current price, change, etc., retrieved from a stock API.

This project serves as a foundation for a more comprehensive stock tracking application.
